		About "Theming"
		
		In Reloaded, for compatibility reasons (such as when new controls are added), the original theme is always loaded.
		
		The way "themes" are supposed to be created; is by overriding internal resources such as colours, brushes and other contents.
		Not everything can be perfectly overwritten but most aspects of the UI can be customized.
		
		This demo overrides the property in Theme/Default/Settings.xaml (at the time of writing).
        Of course, you can import other files directly too. Check out the default theme (Default.xaml).

    <!-- 
        Inherit Default Theme:
        This is important as hitting this in the launcher wouldn't reset to the default theme; only make changes
        defined in this file. This can be misleading as this mixed in with the user's last theme might not be what the user
        may desire after a launcher restart.
