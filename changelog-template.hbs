# 1.28.6: Path/Location Warnings & Minor Theme Adjustment 

- @dreamsyntax added [warnings for when Reloaded and/or the `Mods` folder are placed in OneDrive](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/pull/518), or are placed in a special path.

OneDrive you want to avoid for performance reasons.
Special paths you want to avoid because some games don't support them well. Some games may fail to load custom assets out of the mod folders; Reloaded now warns about this indiscriminately.

- @dreamsyntax added [a warning for when a game is places in a path with a special folder](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/pull/516).

Same as above. Sometimes people download old games through 'mysterious ways', place them in a special location and try to mod them before trying even an unmodded game. This way they'll hopefully know that the path may be a problem.

- @dreamsyntax made [a small adjustment on the UI colours](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/issues/500).

Before:

After:

In the interest of accessibility, and people using monitors with interesting contrast ratios; the following adjustment above was made.
The Reloaded theme was originally made on a cheap TN panel; however for some IPS displays and beyond, this change makes a lot of sense.
